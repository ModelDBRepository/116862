This is the readme for the model associated with the papers:

1. Zhu JJ, Uhlrich DJ, Lytton WW (1999) Burst firing in identified rat
geniculate interneurons. Neuroscience 91:1445-60

2. Zhu JJ, Lytton WW, Xue JT, Uhlrich DJ (1999) An intrinsic
oscillation in interneurons of the rat lateral geniculate nucleus. J
Neurophysiol 81:702-11

These model files were supplied by Bill Lytton with the following

This is an attempt to recreate a set of simulations originally
performed in 1994 under NEURON version 3 and last tested in 1999. When
I ran it now it did not behave exactly the same as previously which I
suspect is due to some minor mod file changes on my side rather than
due to any differences among versions. After playing around with the
parameters a little bit I was able to get something that looks
generally like a physiological trace in J Neurophysiol, 81:702--711,
1999, fig. 8b top trace:

This sad preface is simply offered in order to encourage anyone who is
interested in this model to make and post fixes. I'm happy to help
out. Simulation by JJ Zhu
